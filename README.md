# SpringBreak2017
Just a week long project on vacation.

TEMPLATE FILES:
   Just copy the "Templates" folder, paste and rename to whatever.
   There are skeleton files inside.

SPACE SHOOTER:
   Simple space shooter for messing around with and learning TypeScript.

EVERYTHING ELSE:
   Just bare bones skeleton files. Nothing written in those yet.
